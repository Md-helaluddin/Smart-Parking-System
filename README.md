# Smart Parking System

**Grade: 1.7**
## Project Overview
This project models a fully automated Smart Parking System designed to optimize vehicle flow and parking management. The system utilizes RFID technology and sensors to control vehicle access, track parking duration, and automate fee collection.

The primary goal is to model the entire system architecture, including logical constraints, behavioral flows, and structural components to ensure smooth entry and exit operations.

## Key Features
* **RFID Access Control:** Automatically authenticates vehicles at entry and exit gates using RFID cards.
* **Real-Time Slot Detection:** Monitors parking slots using sensors and updates the availability display instantly.
* **Automated Payment Processing:** Calculates parking fees based on the duration of the stay and processes payments before the exit gate opens.
* **Safety & Reliability:** Includes safety protocols to prevent gate closure on vehicles and detects sensor failures automatically.

## System Modeling
The project is designed using SysML and is organized into three main packages:
* **Structure:** Defines the physical and logical components, including the Smart Parking Controller, RFID Reader, and Database.
* **Behavior:** Details the system logic through Activity, State Machine, and Sequence diagrams for entry, exit, and payment flows.
* **Requirements:** Outlines functional and non-functional requirements such as performance, accessibility, and data protection.
